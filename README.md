# seminar-hws25
This is the code repository containing the code for my seminar paper that was written in the HWS25 at the University of Mannheim.

The data that was used for this small project was taken from https://github.com/Denilah/CoMA. This dataset contains examples to finetune LLMs, but in this case, it can also be used to get code snippets
that are undocumented for which the LLMs need to generate a documentation for.

Due to time constraints, only a small subset was used for this project, approximately 15 samples.
